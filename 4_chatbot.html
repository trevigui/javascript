    //script ending prematurely is a sign that a semicolon is missing somewhere.
    //want use the || directly in .includes() method it seems, must multiply the variable call...... for now.

    // variable++ signifies variable+variable but using variable+variable will cause an infinite loop, do not use . But be careful as it uses the working value of your variable, in a loop if the variables changes, variable++ keeps the original value of the variable.
